However, based on the results you provided, it seems like the list of projects was retrieved, but there's no confirmation that the tasks were actually deleted from the \"Alexa Shopping List\" project. \n\nTo ensure the tasks are deleted, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Confirm the project ID: From the data, \"Alexa Shopping List\" has an ID of `2205462830`.\n2. Use the project ID to retrieve all tasks associated with the \"Alexa Shopping List\" project.\n3. Delete each task within that project.\n\nIf you have already performed these steps and tasks have been deleted, then your \"Alexa Shopping List\" should now be empty. If not, you may need to execute additional commands to delete the tasks. If you require further assistance, feel free to ask!",
